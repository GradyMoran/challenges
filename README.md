Java solutions to a selection of HackerRank and ProjectEuler challenges

The HackerRank problems include solutions to medium and hard difficulty problems mostly from the "algorithms" category. They were all done by me in the last two years. The original questions can be found by searching for the folder title (minus underscores) on the HackerRank site.

The ProjectEuler questions were all done by me around early 2017.
